# tools-paper
Code used to make plots for paper 'Tools for the analysis of quantum protocols requiring state generation within a time window'. For the theory behind the code, see our paper at arXiv:2304.12673.

### Window problem
We provide code to compute quantities for the 
window problem. 

### BQC
These files code allow one to compute the quantities related to BQC 

### Figures
The following scripts output the plots from the paper:
